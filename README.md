# -I-want-to-make-a-difference-
��I 'm a child of God and all my HEART BELONGS TO HIM �� I am grateful for all that he has given me and taught me along my life path �� Good is My Heart and my soul, the only one who takes control �� �� �� Love xo   YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF??? I know I am took me 40 to 50 years to figure it out?? Why I had a secret so deep I NEVER TOLD ANYONE!!!! I can tell you now: at 6 or 7 years old, my Grandfather of all people molested me! I kept that secret in for 40 years till I finally found a counselor, I felt completely comfortable with!! I told her!! OMG I felt shell shocked! It tok me sometime and lots more counseling to find the me inside!! She is a pretty good-looking, smart and likes to have fun :-) I am a true christian, and proud of it!! I really believe that all the problems and pain I went through was God's way of telling me! Hey, Debbie slow down and llisten!! That is how I got the title for my book, "Written from MY HEART! I want to make a difference" About how we all have hearts that truly LOVE but we are listening to God talking to us!! We get caught up in the world and all its trappings that we forget , who put us here!! I believe God and Mother Earth gave us this plant to live, grow and prosper! That is why we have the three needs to live, Food, water and shelter! Than God, our Father sent us Jesus to show us how to live!! To be a human with a heart that loves everyone! He died on the cross for our sins and shed his blood down on us to make sure we would live like him! When he said,"Forgive them for they know not what they do" the Holy Spirit inot our hearts that we can live like Jesus or destroy ourself to hell!! Than how to love yourself? First thing one needs to do is listen to their hearts!! Live like people who care about each other! Not being selfish and self centered as MOST ALL HAVE BECOME!! I say LOVING YOURSELF, is really hard if your life has been a horrible, not normal, or not taught right from wrong?? What do you think?? Add anything?? Please do!! I want honest input and suggestions!! Thank you My Buddy for reading all this!?
